# Team Project
Primary focus:

The project explores the relationship between net migration and fertility rates on the population growth in Canada between 1961 and 2021 using “Global Life Expectancy at Birth” dataset from Kaggle. This dataset consists of a comprehensive dataset of life expectancy trends.

Relationships explored:

1.	The relationship between fertility rates and population growth. On further analysis , sex ratio at birth (male births per female births) and life expectancy at birth were also studied and would be benificial for the second part of the team project.
2.	The relationship between net migration and population growth 

For our project, net migration is the net total number of migrants during the period 1961 to 2021. Fertility rate is the number of children that a hypothetical female would have over the course of her life if she experienced the age-specific fertility rates observed in a given calendar year. Furthermore, population growth is the increase in the number of people in Canada during the period 1961 to 2021. 

Approach taken:

Our group members shared their research topic preferences so we could fairly select a topic that was of interest to everyone. Once we had highlighted our interest in ‘Healthcare’, we explored various databases to select the suitable dataset for the project. After shortlisting a few datasets, we dived deeper into each one of them together to explore them further. We analysed the datasets and the variables within it to see their relevance to our topic of interest as well as the business context attached to it. 
After finalising out dataset “Global Life Expectancy at birth”, we divided the tasks within the team so every member contributes effectively in the area of their expertise.  

Patterns/trends identified:

The regression analysis conducted on our dataset can be found in the jupiter nitebook in the 'report' section of our team-project repo.
The relationship between fertility rates and population growth depicted a significant positive correlation. This is shown by the high F-statistic and the low p-value in the regression analysis. The results are statistically significant and for each one-unit increase in the fertility rate, the population growth is expected to increase by 0.4807 units, assuming all other factors remain constant.
The relationship between net migration and population growth showed a low F-statistic and p-value in the regression analysis. It was predicted that this relationship is not statistically significant and therefore it cannot be said that the net migration has any effect on population growth. 

Intended Audience:
1. Policymakers, government officials, and researchers interested in understanding how fertility rates impact population growth.
2. Immigration policymakers, urban planners, and economists interested in understanding the factors influencing population growth trends beyond net migration alone.

Question our analysis is trying to answer:
1. How does the fertility rate (births per woman) affect population growth rates over time?
2. What are the correlations between fertility rates and population growth over different time periods?
3. What are the trends in population growth over a specific period?
4. To what extent does net migration contribute to population growth?

Specific libraries or frameworks:
1. Pandas
2. NumPy
3. Statsmodels
4. Matplotlib
5. Jupyter Notebooks
